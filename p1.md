# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


```for i in range(1,101):

    if(i%3==0 and i%5 !=0):
        print("fizz")
    elif(i%5==0 and i%3 != 0):
        print("buzz")
    elif(i%3==0 and i%5==0):
        print("fizzbuzz")   
    else:
        print(i)```
